   <h3 class = "italic top-space no-hover center">Who I am</a></h3>

      <p>I'm <%= link_to 'Claire Lew', 'http://clairelew.com'%> and I believe that more people should be happy at work.</p>

      <p>I helped start a company, and grow another company. But I've always been struck by how unhappy people are when they aren't able to communicate openly and honestly with one another - and how much that determines the success of a company. </p>

      <p> So I founded ClarityBox. I wanted to create something simple and personal that would help people be happier at work.  <%=link_to 'Click here to learn more about my story.', story_url %> </p>
