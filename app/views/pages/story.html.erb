			<h2>My Story</h2>
			<p>Hi, I'm <%= link_to 'Claire Lew', 'http://clairelew.com'%> and I live in Chicago.</p>
			<p>When I was 13 years old, I bought a book called What Should I Do With My Life?. It was a  precocious move, but it triggered my first questions about how people can pursue meaningful work.</p>
			<p>I attended Northwestern University, where thanks to a few friends I stumbled across my major Learning and Organizational Change. It sparked my realization that organizations have an amazing capacity to solve important problems in our world.</p>
			<p>Ever since then, my passion has been building and improving organizations.  From serving as student body president in college, to helping start a company, to helping growing another company, that is what has consistently motivated the work I've chosen to do.</p>
			<p>Through all of it, I noticed how difficult it was for an organization to improve. Like many people, I experienced the pain of ineffective communication time and time again - and it struck me how painful this problem was. How much simply not knowing how other people feel affects an organization's productivity and happiness.</p>
			<p>I wanted to dedicate myself to solving that problem, so I founded ClarityBox. I wanted to create something simple, genuine, and personal that would help my friends and family communicate better at work. Something that would make them feel a bit happier.</p>
			<p>That is my ultimate quest:  to help more people feel happier at work. It's a long road ahead, but I hope you'll join me for the journey.</p>
