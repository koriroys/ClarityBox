      You wish these decisions were easier. If you knew how your team actually felt about the company, you would know what to take action on.</p>

   <h3 class = "italic top-space no-hover center">Who I am</a></h3>

      <p>I'm <%= link_to 'Claire Lew', 'http://clairelew.com'%> and I believe that more people should be happy at work.</p>

      <p>I helped start a company, and grow another company. But I've always been struck by how many people aren't passionate about what they do. </p>

      <p> So I founded ClarityBox. I wanted to create something simple and personal that would help people be happier at work. Click <%=link_to 'here', story_url %> to learn more.</p>
