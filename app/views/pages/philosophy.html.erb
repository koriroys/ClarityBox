		<h2>My Philosophy</h2>
		<p>I believe people should be happier at work. We spend too much of lives working for us not to be.</p>

		<p>We are unhappiest at work when we feel we can't say what we want. Ineffective communication is the root of almost every organizational problem. The things that go unsaid are what hurt a company the most.</p>

		<p>When we are able to communicate more openly and honestly, we immediately become happier. We can spot problems quicker. We can produce more meaningful outcomes. We feel like the work we do matters.</p>

		<p>Clarity is the starting point. A company must first see itself clearly in order to improve moving forward. </p>

		<p>When a company cares about clarity, it becomes a place where people <em>want</em> to work.</p>

		<p>I believe creating such companies are possible. A better, happier world will exist because of it.</p>


		<p>Here is what I care about:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Being authentic</b>: Nothing matters if the intention isn't there.</li>
			<li><b>Keeping things simple</b>: Cut out everything except what's essential.</li>
			<li><b>Honesty</b>:  Seek the truth while knowing your own bias.</li>
			<li><b>Trust</b>: If you lose it, you don't deserve to have it back.</li>
		</ul>
