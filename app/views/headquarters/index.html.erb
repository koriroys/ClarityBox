      <p>As your company grows, it's hard to know how your employees feel about your company. You wonder:</p>
<ul>
    <li>What do my employees love about the company?</li>
    <li>What are the unspoken frustrations?</li>
    <li>What should I be doing differently?</li>
    <li>Where should I be focusing my time and energy?</li>
</ul>

        If you had greater insight into your company, you would know what to take action on.

        I helped start a <%= link_to 'company', 'http://starterleague.com' %>, and grow another <%= link_to 'company', 'http://mightynest.com/'%>. But I've always been struck by how unhappy people are when they aren't able to communicate openly and honestly with one another - and how much that impacts a company.

      <p>
        So I founded ClarityBox. I wanted to create a solution to help people be happier at work.  <%=link_to 'Click here to learn more about my story.', story_url %>
